    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});
```
You can also pass the `uglify` function any of the options [listed here](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#the-simple-way) to modify uglify's behavior.

## Custom Options

### preserveComments
Type: `Boolean`, `String`, `Function`
Default: `undefined`
Options: `true` `'all'` `'some'`

Turn on preservation of comments. (*Will be parsed to options.output.comments*)
(Credits to [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify))

- `true` || `'all'` will preserve all comments in code blocks that have not been squashed or dropped
- `'some'` will preserve all comments that start with a bang (`!`) or include a closure compiler style directive (`@preserve` `@license` `@cc_on`)
- `function` specify your own comment preservation function. You will be passed the current node and the current comment and are expected to return either `true` or `false`
